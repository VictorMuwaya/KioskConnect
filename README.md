# KioskConnect 📦

**KioskConnect** is a B2B bulk inventory pooling platform designed specifically for micro-retailers (like "Dukas" or "Spaza shops"). It empowers small business owners to compete with large supermarkets by aggregating their purchasing power.

## 🚀 The Problem
Small neighborhood shops typically buy inventory in tiny quantities. This leads to:
- **Higher Costs:** They pay premium retail prices instead of wholesale.
- **Logistics Issues:** High delivery fees for small, frequent orders.
- **Capital Constraints:** Lack of storage and cash flow to buy in bulk individually.

## 💡 The Solution
KioskConnect allows shop owners to "pool" their orders for common goods (flour, oil, soap, etc.) to collectively hit wholesale thresholds.

### 🔄 The Creative Twist
- **Drop Point Coordination:** The app designates a "Drop Point" (usually the largest or most accessible shop in a cluster) for a single large delivery, drastically reducing logistics costs for everyone.
- **PWA First:** Built as a Progressive Web App to ensure it works on low-end smartphones and remains functional in areas with spotty internet connectivity.
- **AI-Powered Insights:** Uses the Gemini API to provide smart pooling advice, market trend forecasting, and inventory optimization tips.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Intelligent Dashboard:** Track estimated savings, active pools, and community impact through visual analytics.
- **Wholesale Marketplace:** Browse products specifically curated for micro-retailers with clear retail vs. wholesale price comparisons.
- **Live Pooling Status:** Real-time progress bars showing how close a neighborhood is to hitting a wholesale target.
- **KioskConnect AI Assistant:** A floating AI helper that analyzes inventory needs and suggests the best time to join a pool based on market trends.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** React 19, Tailwind CSS.
- **Icons:** Font Awesome.
- **Data Visualization:** Recharts.
- **Intelligence:** Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`).
- **Permissions:** Geolocation (for finding nearby pools and drop points).

## 🌍 Business Impact
By lowering the **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**, KioskConnect makes micro-retailers more competitive, increases their profit margins, and strengthens the local community economy.
